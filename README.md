💫 About Me:

I'm currently working on 🛠️<br>
As a Python enthusiast on a journey to mastering the art of coding, I'm diving into projects that challenge and inspire me.<br>
Right now, I'm working on:<br>
Python Projects: From building automation scripts to exploring data analysis, Python is my go-to language as I sharpen my skills.<br>
I'm constantly pushing the limits of what I can create, learning new libraries, and refining my code.<br>
JavaScript & Go on the Horizon: As I progress through my courses at boot.dev, I'll be expanding my toolkit with JavaScript and Go projects.<br>
The adventure is just beginning, and I'm excited to add more languages to my arsenal.<br>

I'm looking to collaborate with 🤝<br>
If you’ve somehow stumbled upon this page and are looking to team up on beginner-friendly projects, you’re in the right place!<br>
I’m all about learning by doing, so if you’re a fellow coding enthusiast eager to create something cool together, let’s make it happen.<br>
It's a win-win for leveling up our skills.<br>
And if you happen to be a recruiter or employer who enjoys giving newcomers a shot, I’m ready to rise to the challenge. Excelsior!<br>

I'm looking for help with 💡<br>
If you’re in search of a committed coding partner, you’ve come to the right place.<br>
I’ll be honest—I’m not a pro just yet, but I’m steadily making my way, one topic at a time. It’s not always a smooth ride, but the challenges are what make the journey worthwhile.<br>
If you happen to spot something in my projects that could use improvement, I’m all ears.<br>
Constructive criticism is always welcome—after all, that’s how we grow.<br>

I'm currently learning 📚<br>
I’m currently diving deep into the Back-end Developer Career Path at boot.dev.<br>
This course is guiding me through the essential skills needed to thrive in the back-end world.<br>
Here's what I'm working on:<br>
Python, JavaScript, and Go: Building a strong foundation in these languages, mastering their core concepts, and learning to apply them in real-world scenarios.<br>
Data Structures & Algorithms: Understanding the backbone of efficient coding and problem-solving strategies.<br>
APIs & Databases: Learning how to create, manage, and optimize back-end systems that power modern applications.<br>Real-World Projects: Applying everything I learn through hands-on projects that simulate real-life challenges.<br>

It’s a lot to take in, but I'm determined to keep pushing forward, after all, who am I to fail?<br>

Ask me about 🤔<br>
Got a burning question about Python, JavaScript, Go, or why coffee is the best debugging tool?<br>
I'm your guy! Whether it's coding challenges, random tech stuff, or just nerdy chatter, feel free to reach out. I may not have all the answers, but I’ll give it my best shot—plus, I love a good excuse to dive into something new.<br>

Fun fact 🎬<br>
As I’m learning to write cleaner code, did you know that the movie Die Hard was originally a sequel to Commando? <br>
Just like how I’m trying to turn my coding journey into an action-packed adventure — minus the explosions, of course. (оf course 😈)
